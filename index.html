<h3> Work samples in R </h3>
<a href="01HarryPotter.html">1. Harry Potter - An Analysis on the Moods</a>
<br>
<i>This is a fun unstructured data analytics project that is based on a data set including all text for the series of Harry Potter book. Questions to answer include, but are not limited to: Does the sentiment analysis on single words tell the true story? How does sentiment change as readers (in this case, RStudio and certain lexicon packages) progress through the chapters in each book? If the sentiment is analyzed on a bigram basis, how does the overall result change? What about analyzing on a sentence basis? How does text analytics vary among different lexicons? At the end of the project, it also includes a section of image/objection detection that examines on some famous movie scenes from Harry Potter.</i>

<p>
<a href="02ManhattanProperty.html">2. Manhattan Property</a>
<br>
<i>This project is based on a mega data set of properties in Manhattan. It begins with the cleaning and processing of the data set of a relatively massive volume, and continues on with regression analysis, visualization, and correlation analysis.</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<a href="03WWEEarningsCall.html">3. WWE Earnings Call</a>
<br>
<i>This project starts with text analytics, investigating on topics of term frequency and sentiment with regard to the text that appears in the call transcripts. Further, as the stock price would be the major indicator of a public companyâ€™s performance from a financial period, the aforementioned text analytics results would be incorporated with the fluctuation of stock prices overtime.</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<a href="04EffectiveLeader.html">4. Effective Leader</a>
<br>
<i>This short project conducts regression analysis on a data set of factors that would possibly impact how effective a leader could be. Relevant regression diagnosis procedures are also included with responsive sampling solutions such as bootstrapping.</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<a href="05Glassdoor.html">5. Glassdoor</a>
<br>
<i>This project is based on a dataset from Glassdoor.com. It is built for various purposes: (1) Exploration about the unigram term frequency, tf-idf, and bigram presence of the text in pro reviews, con reviews, and advice. (2) What rating type has an outstanding pattern other than the rest and is worthy of further inspection? (3) How does the sentiment scores shown in pro reviews, con reviews, and advice affect the rating of interest? (4) Topic modeling for pro reviews, con reviews, and advice. (5) For the topics modeled, how does rating impact the mapping of such topics?</i>

<a href="06GooglePlayAppStore.html">6. Google Play App Store</a>
<br>
<i>Google Play App Store Analysis: There are many factors that affect the reviews and ratings of the applications available in Google's Play App Store market. To name a few: the genre, the download size, the content rating, the frequency of updates, the pricing, and etc. These could be individual contributors to the matter. Or, they could impact the final ratings and reviews in an interactive manner. This project aims to investigate on this issue by conducting regression analysis on the data such as the ANOVA test and the t-test. Given the techniques applied, certain limitations are presented; further insights are subsequently derived.</i>

<a href="07Wine.html">7. Wine</a>
<br>
<i>This short project creates several visualization utilizing a data set about worldwide wine information.</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<a href="08ML-Clustering.html">8. Machine Learning - Clustering</a>
<br>
<i>A customer segmentation for a local mall.</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<a href="09ML-DecisionTreeLogistic.html">9. Machine Learning - Decision Tree, Logistic</a>
<br>
<i>A short study on types of mushroom leveraging the techniques including decision tree and logistic modeling.</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<a href="10Attrition.html">10. Attrition</a>
<br>
<i>This short project conducts exploratory and descriptive analysis on an in-built dataset: attrition.</i>

<h3> Work samples in Python </h3>
<a href="wine.html">1. Wine Quality Prediction</a>
<br>
<i> The goal of this project is to see if any of the wine features impact the quality (ratings) granted to the wines. It includes some preliminary analysis, correlation analysis, data visualization, and finally, applying and comparing the results of logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest for ordinal data analysis, binary data analysis (unbalanced dataset), and categorical data analysis.</i>
<br>
<a href="flightdelayfinalnew.html">2. Flight Delay & Cancellation Analysis</a>
<br>
<i> This project investigates on questions related to flight delays and flight cancellations, and it aims to share some insights for relevant entities on how to avoid delays and optimize the operation of relevant facilities. The main topics include: in which month(s) do flight delays occur most frequently? Do fly delays happen more during the daytime or the nighttime? Is the frequency of flight delays correlated to the ariline carriers in any way? It also comes with some extensive experiment with data visualization through Python (9 Viz included).</i>
<br>
<a href="moviesfinal.html">3. Web Scraping - Movies from the IMDb.com </a>
<br>
<i>The first section of this project scrapes the movies released in 2020 and their respective information. The second section scrapes from multiple pages (i.e. top movies released in different years) and a distribution analysis regarding the scraped result. The third part scrapes the all-time top-rated movies according to IMDb.com.</i>
