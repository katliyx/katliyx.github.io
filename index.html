<a href="01HarryPotter.html">1. Harry Potter - An Analysis on the Moods</a>
<br>
<i>This is a fun unstructured data analytics project that is based on a data set including all text for the series of Harry Potter book. Questions to answer include, but are not limited to: Does the sentiment analysis on single words tell the true story? How does sentiment change as readers (in this case, RStudio and certain lexicon packages) progress through the chapters in each book? If the sentiment is analyzed on a bigram basis, how does the overall result change? What about analyzing on a sentence basis? How does text analytics vary among different lexicons? At the end of the project, it also includes a section of image/objection detection that examines on some famous movie scenes from Harry Potter.</i>
